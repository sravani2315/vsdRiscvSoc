What is the ‘A’ in rv32imac?
The ‘A’ stands for Atomic instructions extension.

It adds atomic memory operations that allow multiple instructions to perform read-modify-write operations atomically (without interruption).

These instructions are critical for synchronization primitives like mutexes, spinlocks, semaphores, and for building lock-free data structures.

Key atomic instructions added:
LR.W (Load Reserved Word)
Loads a word and marks the address for an atomic update.

SC.W (Store Conditional Word)
Stores a word only if no conflicting writes occurred since the corresponding LR.W.

AMOSWAP.W
Atomically swaps a register and memory.

AMOADD.W
Atomically adds a register to memory.

AMOXOR.W, AMOAND.W, AMOOR.W, AMOMIN.W, AMOMAX.W, AMOMINU.W, AMOMAXU.W
Atomic bitwise and min/max operations.

Why is this useful?
Enables lock-free synchronization in operating systems, multithreaded applications, and real-time kernels.

Provides hardware support for atomic read-modify-write sequences, avoiding complex software locking schemes.

Improves performance and correctness in concurrent environments.

In contrast:
rv32imc lacks this ‘A’ extension, so atomic operations must be emulated in software, which is slower and more error-prone.
