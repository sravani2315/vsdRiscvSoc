🛠️ RISC-V Toolchain Setup Guide (RV32IMAC)

This guide walks you through unpacking the RISC-V toolchain, setting up your environment, and verifying the installation on a Linux system.

---   

📦 1. Unpack the Toolchain

Open a terminal and extract the toolchain archive:


bash
tar -xvzf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
```

This will extract a folder, typically named `opt` or `riscv-toolchain`, containing the toolchain binaries.

---

📁 2. Locate the `bin/` Directory

Navigate to the extracted folder’s `bin` directory:
<pre> ```bash riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c spike pk hello ``` </pre>

```cd /path/to/extracted/folder/opt/riscv/bin```

> Replace `/path/to/extracted/folder` with the actual path to the extracted contents.

List the contents to verify:

```bash
ls
```

You should see executables such as:

* `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`
* `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump`
* `riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb`

---
🌐 3. Add Toolchain to Your `PATH`

🔹 Temporary (Current Session Only)

```bash
export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
```
🔹 Permanent (Recommended)

🔸 For **Bash** users:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/home/naren/Desktop/VSD/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

🔸 For **Zsh** users:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/home/naren/Desktop/VSD/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

> Adjust the path if your toolchain is located elsewhere.

---

✅ 4. Verify the Installation

Run the following commands to check if the toolchain is accessible:

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
```

If installed correctly, these commands will return version information for each tool.
