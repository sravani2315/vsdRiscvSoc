✅ Install & Sanity-Check RISC-V Toolchain (rv32imac)
🔧 1. Unpack the Toolchain
Assuming you downloaded riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz into your home directory or ~/Downloads:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Navigate to your preferred install location
cd $HOME

# Extract the tar.gz file (adjust path if needed)
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
✅ This will create a directory like riscv or similar in your home folder.

🛠️ 2. Add Toolchain to PATH
To make the RISC-V tools globally available, add the following to your ~/.bashrc:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the changes immediately
source ~/.bashrc
📝 Note: Replace $HOME/riscv/bin with the actual path if it differs after extraction (e.g., $HOME/riscv-toolchain/bin).

✅ 3. Sanity Check – Confirm Tools Are Working
Run the following commands to verify installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
✅ If correctly installed, each command should print version information.
