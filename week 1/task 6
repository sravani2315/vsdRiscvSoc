✅ 6. Stepping with riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb
This guide assumes you're using the GDB built with the RISC-V simulator backend, often called gdbsim.

🧪 Step-by-Step: Start GDB and Run Your ELF
🛠️ 1. Launch GDB with your ELF
bash
Copy
Edit
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb hello.elf
🖥️ 2. Start the RISC-V Simulator
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) target sim
✅ This tells GDB to run your program inside its built-in RISC-V simulator.

⛔ 3. Set a Breakpoint at main
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) break main
🛑 Sets a breakpoint before the main() function begins.

▶️ 4. Run the Program
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) run
🏃 Program runs until main is hit.

🪜 5. Step Through Instructions
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) stepi      # Step one instruction
(gdb) nexti      # Step over one instruction
🧠 6. Inspect Registers
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) info registers       # View all general-purpose registers
(gdb) info registers a0    # View specific register
🧩 7. Disassemble Code at Current PC
gdb
Copy
Edit
(gdb) disassemble
Shows surrounding assembly instructions near the program counter (PC).
