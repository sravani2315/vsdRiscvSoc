✅ 1. SCL 180 nm PDK installed and environment variables exported
PDK Installation: Ensure the Standard Cell Library for SCL 180nm technology is installed correctly.

Environment Variables: These usually include paths to the PDK libraries, setup files, and tech files.

Common example in your .bashrc or .bash_profile:

bash
Copy
Edit
export SCL_HOME=/path/to/scl_180nm_pdk
export PDK_PATH=$SCL_HOME
source $SCL_HOME/setup/env.csh  # or env.sh depending on your shell
✅ 2. Synopsys VCS & Design Compiler available on your PATH
Confirm by running:

bash

which vcs
which dc_shell
If these return valid paths, the tools are available in your PATH.

If not, add Synopsys tools to your PATH:

bash

export PATH=/path/to/synopsys/vcs/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/path/to/synopsys/dc/bin:$PATH
✅ 3. vsdRiscvScl180 project cloned locally and Week 1 smoke-test simulation working
You should have the GitHub project cloned:

bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/vsdRiscvScl180.git
cd vsdRiscvScl180
Smoke Test: Week 1 simulation usually involves verifying RTL (possibly a simple RISC-V core or controller) to ensure the environment is working. You can usually run something like:

bash
make run_week1_smoke_test

or manually:

bash
vcs -full64 -sverilog rtl/top.v tb/top_tb.v -o simv
./simv
