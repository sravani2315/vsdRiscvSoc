✅ Step-by-Step Packaging Guide
📁 1. Organize Directory Structure
In your project root, make sure you have this directory layout:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p week2/docs
Then move or copy the required files into it:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Documentation
cp docs/week2_notes.md week2/docs/
cp docs/hierarchy.txt week2/docs/

# RTL file list
cp synopsys/filelist.f week2/synopsys/

# Logs
cp compile.log run.log week2/

# Screenshot
cp screenshot_run_log.png week2/
📦 2. Final Folder Structure Should Look Like:
lua
Copy
Edit
vsdRiscvScl180/
└── week2/
    ├── docs/
    │   ├── week2_notes.md
    │   └── hierarchy.txt
    ├── synopsys/
    │   └── filelist.f
    ├── compile.log
    ├── run.log
    └── screenshot_run_log.png
📌 Replace screenshot_run_log.png with whatever filename you saved the terminal screenshot as.

🚀 3. Submission Instructions
Now, wait for your mentor’s instruction on how to submit:

Submission Mode	Command / Action
Git (Branch + PR)	git checkout -b week2_<yourname>
git add week2/
git commit -m "Week 2 submission"
git push origin week2_<yourname> and create PR
Zipped Archive	zip -r week2_submission.zip week2/ and send/upload the .zip
Direct Upload	Use mentor’s platform or email as instructed
